This is my Web Development 2 module project for Year 2 semester 3. The project consists of using PHP and MYSQL for the back-end and HTML, Javascript and CSS for the front-end. 
For this project we were required to create a library website that allows the user to register and log in and be able to reserve and unreserve a book of their liking. The user is 
also able to search for their book by title , author or description using partial search.
